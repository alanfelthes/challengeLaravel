#Challenge

In the coding challenge we would like you to build a small application that allows the user to login to a portal and create a new article. The article has a title, body and an image. Only one user should be able to login with credentials “test@3sixtyfactory.com” and the password of “test12345”. You should also expose a simple API that would allow third parties to view all articles from a given user as well as view details of a single article. 
The code does not need to be uploaded anywhere, you can share the code via Github or send it as a ZIP file. 

#Results

I develop using Laravel 8.x.x and sent to a server so is it possible to see working.

https://phplaravel-204296-2081233.cloudwaysapps.com/

Pass: test12345

To access the the Json API you can use the URL's:
